# GCS-LiCAS
Simple Ground Control Station (GCS) program in C++ for sending LiCAS operation codes through UDP socket. Each operation code is an integer number corresponding to a task implemented by the LiCAS Control Program. This GCS also sends keep alive messages so the LiCAS can detect connection loss.
